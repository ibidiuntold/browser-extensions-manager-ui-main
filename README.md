# Frontend Mentor - Browser extensions manager UI solution

This is a solution to the [Browser extensions manager UI challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/browser-extension-manager-ui-yNZnOfsMAp). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. I decided to challenge myself with this project after gaining sufficient JavaScript knowledge in tandem with my prior experience with HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- ChatGPT
- Copilot helped a lot in generating some lines of code and suggesting optimal settings to write my code. 


### What I learned

- I learned how to call back functions in Javascript. 
- I also learned how to toggle between light theme mode and dark theme using pure CSS
- I learned how to properly nest <div></div> elements in my line of code so that the proper styling can be done


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - This helped me for my switch and toggle design. I really like how they break down concepts and I will be referring to their website pretty often. 
- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/) - This is another amazing site that provided a much needed documentation on various HTML, CSS and JavaScript concept. I figure it will be an helpful site for you.

A big shoutout to [Fortune Precious](https://githum.com/dpthenicest) who helped me figure out how to style the Switch Toggle. I was inspired by his explanation and was able to come up with a design philosophy.
